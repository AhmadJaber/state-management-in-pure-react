*** setState(), Patterns & AntiPatterns.

	# Things I should do / shouldn't do, predominantly not do with state management.

	a. one thing we need to remember -> When we are working with props we have "propTypes".
	That's not the case with state. If we use "ts" or "flow" we don't have to think about that.

	b. should we keep something in actual react-state?
	
	c. Do not use this.state() for derivation of props.
